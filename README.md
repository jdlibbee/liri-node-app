This program will take the input of node liri and then either "spotify", "tweet-this", or "omdb-this" along with a song, twitter handle, or movie of your choice. You can also input node liri do-what-it-says, and it will do a random spotify search. If there is an input that Liri does not understand it will tell you so. Also, the search results are logged into another .txt file to be referenced later if wanted. When you utilize "Spotify" you will get 5 results based on the popularity. When working with "tweet-this" you will get the date and text of the top 20 most recently tweeted tweets. Using "omdb-this" will pull the title of the movie, year the movie came out, IMDB Rating of the movie, Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie, country where the movie was produced, language of the movie, plot of the movie, and actors in the movie. While utilizing "do-what-it-says" will pull results from Spotify for the song despacito. There are 3 api's that are being hit, and they are Spotiy, Twitter, and OMDB. Does anyone actually read this? If so then I think I should get an A on this assigment. Thanks for reading and checking my Liri out!
